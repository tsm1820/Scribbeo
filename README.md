## _The best way to take time-stamped notes from videos!_


# Project Overview
The **Chrome Extension** provides a note-taking interface to take time-stamped notes while watching YouTube videos. It offers a timed transcript of the notes taken previously for users to refer to while watching their videos.

**Key Features:**
1. All notes taken are attached to specific time stamps in conjunction with the video.
2. Clicking on a note at a particular time-stamp takes the user back to that time in the video. 
3. Notes are highlighted in the form of a live transcript according to time-stamps as the video plays.
4. All notes pertaining to one video can be saved in a single document inside the extension for future reference.  



## Motivation

When you are rushing to take down notes from a video, it does take some time to adjust your notes application and the video to be beside each other. In the end, we resort to switching between tabs or adjusting the size of our notes application multiple times as we are typing. Moreover, looking back at the notes, it is likely that we are confused as to what the context was in regards to the video. To make it less of a hassle, we are intending to create a chrome extension that allows us to type down notes with the timestamps of the videos included - so your notes get highlighted at particular timestamps as the video is playing. Furthermore, the notes you type down also get automatically saved to Google Docs for you to refer to later on.
